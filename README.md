# Dog Breed Identification with Deep Learning
This project focuses on implementing deep learning for dog breed identification using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The primary goal is to create a robust model capable of accurately classifying and identifying dog breeds from images. The project includes training, validation testing, and fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance.

## Key Features
  1. Deep Learning with Keras and TensorFlow: Utilizes Keras as the high-level neural networks API and TensorFlow as the underlying deep learning framework for building and training the dog breed identification model.

  2. AWS S3 Environment: The code is designed to run on an AWS S3 environment, providing scalability and efficient computation resources for training deep learning models.

  3. Training and Validation Testing: Implements a training pipeline to train the model on a labeled dataset and validate its performance using a separate validation set.

  4. Fine-Tuning: Incorporates fine-tuning techniques to enhance the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.

  5. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification

The current model accuracy is at 90%. This is to be improved.
